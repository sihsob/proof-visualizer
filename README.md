# proof-diagram
Visualize Fitch styled proofs in the form of argument diagrams with proof validation.  Project created for Bram van Heuveln's Intermediate Logic course.

###What are Arugument Diagrams?
Traditionally used to represent arguments in natural language in a tree like structure.  Argument diagrams show the structure of arguments and allows one to easily find the important parts of the diagram.  These diagrams also help to show the structure and "lines of reasoning".  The method of creating these diagrams also helps to remove redundancies and unnecessary information.  Conveniently, argument diagrams transfer over fairly well for formal proofs.  Proofs can now be visually represented while retaining their step-by-step process and subproofs.
